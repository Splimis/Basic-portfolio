			I was born in St. Louis, Missouri and almost immediately moved to Lawrence, New York. Some time later I
			moved to Freehold, New Jersey and graduated Freehold Township Highschool. Upon graduation I attended college
			at Wagner in Staten Island, New York. After my third symester I dropped out, as there is no money in being
			a music major. I then attended Lincoln Technical Institue in Newark and graduated with a --- avarage. I have
			been working in the automotive field ever since.
